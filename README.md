# rustpay

This is rustpay, a more secure and sound way to handle centralized transactions.

## What is this?

Inspired by crypto and blockchain (however, not relying on these technologies) this project aims to put control of ones own funds stored at banks back into their own control.

Right now, this is more of an experiment than an actual piece of production-ready software. A writeup with more details will follow sometime in the future.
